These sums of sinusoids often give us interesting patterns from which we can determine the underlying structure. One such example is in the science of interferometry (try googling Michelson interferometer). Light sourcces are often made of individual lines with a fixed wavlengths and with a Michelson Interferometer, through very tiny movements of a mirror we are able to see the individual peaks and trough of light waves. When we have two  lines very close to each we see a superposition of the two waves.\n",
